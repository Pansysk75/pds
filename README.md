# Finding the Strongly Connected Components of a directed graph in a shared memory multiprocessor

*Assignment for 2022-2023 Parallel and Distributed Systems course, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki*

A strongly connected component (SCC) is a maximal subgraph of a directed graph in which there is a path 
from each vertex to any other vertex in the subgraph.  

In this assignment, I'm implementing a parallel algorithm to identify the number of SCCs in large directed graphs.  

I also compare its performance and scalability to the state-of-the-art sequential algorithms by Tarjan and Kosaraju.
